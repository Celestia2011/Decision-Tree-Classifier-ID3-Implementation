# **Decision Tree Classifier (ID3) Implementation**

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the **ID3 algorithm** on a weather dataset to predict whether or not to play based on weather conditions. It covers the following steps:
1. Dataset preprocessing.
2. Calculation of entropy and information gain for each feature.
3. Decision tree construction.
4. Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
5. Visualization of the final decision tree.
### Features
- **Outlook**: Categorical (Sunny, Overcast, Rainy)
- **Temperature**: Categorical (Hot, Mild, Cool)
- **Humidity**: Categorical (High, Normal)
- **Windy**: Boolean (True, False)
- **Play**: Target label (Yes/No)
