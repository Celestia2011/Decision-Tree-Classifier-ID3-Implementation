Decision Tree Classifier (ID3) Implementation
Project Overview

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier using the ID3 algorithm on a small weather dataset to predict whether or not to play based on weather conditions. It covers the following steps:

    Dataset preprocessing.
    Calculation of entropy and information gain for each feature.
    Decision tree construction.
    Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
    Visualization of the final decision tree.

Features

    Outlook: Categorical (Sunny, Overcast, Rainy)
    Temperature: Categorical (Hot, Mild, Cool)
    Humidity: Categorical (High, Normal)
    Windy: Boolean (True, False)
    Play: Target label (Yes/No)
